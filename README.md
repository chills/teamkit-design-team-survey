This is Open Source and you can contribute back to the community by creating a branch with your version of the survey. 

*What does this survey measure?*

The purpose of the survey is to understand how individuals are feeling about the following factors: 
-   the team member's thoughts about their career development plans and goals;
-   the team member's feelings about their manager, their operational team and leadership;
-   the team member's feelings about their delivery/project team (eg. embedded designers in agile teams); and 
-   the team member's perception the wider organisation

The survey can be used as a one-off or a routine benchmark. 
It incorporates tried and tested frameworks such as eNPS, psychological safety and team functioning, as well as systems thinking.*

Team Kit for UX and Design teams is awesome!

*This survey is set up for direct import into Survey Monkey*

How to use the Team Health Text file for Survey Monkey:
1)  Open Survey Monkey and "create a new survey from scratch"
2)  Add a title eg. "[YY/MM] UX and Design Team Health Survey courtesy of Team Kit!"
3)  Choose a category eg. Human Resources or UX and Design Team Managers 
    
PRO-TIP: for employee confidentiality maintain a permissions managed repository of team surveys just for people managers       and leaders otherwise all-team access can be awkward :-)

4)  Select the checkbox that says "My questions are already written"
5)  Then, open your UX and Design Team Health survey text file and select everything
6)  Your next action is to copy and paste the contents of the text file into the open comment field displayed in Survey           Monkey, titled "Copy and Paste Questions" 
7)  Hit "Add Questions" in the dialoge box and you're done!
