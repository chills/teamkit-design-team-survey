*This is the README for the UX and Design Team Health Survey - created for Survey Monkey*

Version 1.1 of the UX and Design Team Health survey has been influenced by the following frameworks:
-   https://www.tablegroup.com/books/dysfunctions (team dynamics)
-   https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/ (1, 2 and 3)
-   http://www.netpromotersystem.com/about/employee-engagement.aspx (using benchmark recommendation scale for promoter score)
-   https://www.andykelk.net/devops/using-the-westrum-typology-to-measure-culture (see test information)

*What does this survey measure?*

The purpose of the survey is to understand how individuals are feeling about the following factors relating to the team member's perception of and satisfaction with: 
-   their career development plans and goals;
-   their manager, operational function and leadership;
-   their delivery/project team (eg. embedded designers in agile teams); and 
-   the wider organisation

Team Kit for UX and Design teams is awesome!

*This survey is set up for direct import into Survey Monkey*

How to use the Team Health Text file for Survey Monkey:
1)  Open Survey Monkey and "create a new survey from scratch"
2)  Add a title eg. "[YY/MM] UX and Design Team Health Survey courtesy of Team Kit!"
3)  Choose a category eg. Human Resources or UX and Design Team Managers 
    
PRO-TIP: for employee confidentiality maintain a permissions managed repository of team surveys just for people managers       and leaders otherwise all-team access can be awkward :-)

4)  Select the checkbox that says "My questions are already written"
5)  Then, open your UX and Design Team Health survey text file and select everything
6)  Your next action is to copy and paste the contents of the text file into the open comment field displayed in Survey           Monkey, titled "Copy and Paste Questions" 
7)  Hit "Add Questions" in the dialogue box and you're done!
