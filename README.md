*Team Health Survey - Team Health Survey for Survey Monkey*

How to use the Team Health Text file for Survey Monkey:
1)  Open Survey Monkey and "create a new survey from scratch"
2)  Add a title eg. "[YY/MM] UX and Design Team Health Survey courtesy of Team Kit!"
3)  Choose a category eg. Human Resources or UX and Design Team Managers 
    PRO-TIP: for employee confidentiality maintain a permissions managed repository of team surveys just for people managers       and leaders otherwise team access can be awkard
4)  Select the checkbox that says "My questions are already written"
5)  Then, open your UX and Design Team Health survey text file and select everything
6)  Your next action is to copy and paste the contents of the text file into the open comment field displayed in Survey           Monkey, titled "Copy and Paste Questions" 
7)  Hit "Add Questions" in the dialoge box and you're done!
